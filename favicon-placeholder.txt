FAVICON FILES NEEDED:

To complete the website setup, you need to create the following favicon files:

1. favicon-32x32.png - 32x32 pixel PNG icon
2. favicon-16x16.png - 16x16 pixel PNG icon  
3. apple-touch-icon.png - 180x180 pixel PNG icon for iOS devices
4. favicon.ico - Standard ICO file (optional but recommended)

You can create these using:
- Online tools like https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- Design software (Photoshop, GIMP, Figma)
- Converting your logo (Images/Logo.png) to these sizes

Recommended approach:
1. Take your existing logo from Images/Logo.png
2. Use https://realfavicongenerator.net/ to generate all favicon variants
3. Download and place them in the root directory
4. Test by visiting your site and checking the browser tab icon

The HTML is already configured to use these files.
